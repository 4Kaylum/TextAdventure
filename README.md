# TextAdventure

This is by no means meant to be any kind of finished, final product. This repository is simply marking me trying to work out how to properly use Java. I started this repo 12 hours ago (as of the initial commit of this readme) and I've already learned a whole bunch. So yes, this is meant to be nothing formal, just a simple boy learning simple things.

## Adventures

If you want to create your own adventure, all you need to do is look at the [design spec](Adventure%20File%20Design/README.md).
