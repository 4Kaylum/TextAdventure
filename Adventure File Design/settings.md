# Settings

The `.settings` file is read when the game is initialized, and never more. As such, it describes things that change how the game is played.

## Attributes

* starting_location (str)
	* This should hold the ID of the location where the player starts.
* debug (bool)
	* This is a simple testing option that lets you see the output of the parser.
